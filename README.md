Raylib C# Bindings generated by CppSharp

## RaylibGenerator

Generates bindings for the raylib headers

### Issues

When building the raylib headers, CppSharp will throw some errors about some missing types. This is because in a typical C/C++ project, raylib.h is already included in the project prior to including one of the other headers (physac, raymath, etc). This is fixed by including raylib.h near the top of each of the headers with the errors.

Additionally, some errors are thrown about type coercion from int to float. This can be fixed by adding an explicit cast where those errors are cropping up.

## RaylibGeneratorTest

Tests generated bindings with a trivial raylib example.
